# gem-url-builder

This is an utility to build an url leveraging functional programming approaches

# Disclaimer

This package has not been veiwed through a security and performance lens. This does not claim to be production ready . There are some aspects only that is production ready. This probably will not satisfy the functional programming purists.My justification is that this is a learning process for me and any critical assesment is welcome

# Intended Usage

This is to show case a real life production package with all the bells and whistles required for a production ready release.
For instance this includes features listed below.

- Manage configuration across various environments
- Extensive Quality checks with unit tests
- Monitor and Attest the Code Quality with code coverage which is one of the prerecquistes for a sucessful agile shop.

* Integrated with [babel](https://babeljs.io/en/setup#installation) to permit ES 2016 features.
* Integrated with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for deployment.

**This is to meet the need for a production ready approach rather than just a bare bones tutorial meant to demostrate the concepts.**
However not this is not yet production ready . There are a number of prerequites that are missing. The intent is to provide approaches to some of chalenges that are encountered when a real life production release is attempted.
